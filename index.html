        <h3>First, there was the drive out...</h3>
        <p>There were two legs to this journey. It was obviously a day where we had class, and while I didn't want to miss it, I'd let my TF know I could potentially be absent or at least late. I knew people had been filtering into the path of totality for roughly an age, so I operated on the assumption that all of them filtering out at once might take a while to get through. Still, for the first leg I drove my car alone, leading the rest of the family in my dad's auto to the campus. Apparently the GPS wasn't overly fond of the address I gave them and they couldn't find it on their own. Regardless, we made it there, I hopped over to the "chase" car, and we then made our way out to Washington, as my aunt and uncle owned land a few miles out from the center of totality.</p>
        <footer id="sectionfooter">The trip was otherwise uneventful, and I slept through most of the second leg. Waking up at 5 am was never a ton of fun.</footer>

        <h3>It didn't take long for us to arrive.</h3>
        <p>We were greeted by two very happy dogs, jumping in and out of the car (at times climbing over the occupants to get inside and through), which was an unexpected surprise. The second-worst part of the journey over, we unpacked the chairs, canopy, food, and other equipment we'd brought. My parents being amateur photographers that nonetheless love the craft, having extensively documented most of our vacations since I've been born, they'd rented a second camera and bought a sun-viewing filter so they could safely photograph the mass of incandescent gas. We took our time saying hi, catching up, and setting up our viewing area on the eastern end of their property. By the time it was done, we had some blankets laid out to catch shadow snakes (we didn't, but they were there), a camera set up on a tripod to take pictures of the sun as the moon obscured it, and a bunch of chairs to sit on.</p>
        <footer id="sectionfooter">My father being the lovable fool he is opted to use the cooler instead, rather than raise the tripod any further.</footer>
        <p>It wasn't long before the eclipse had properly started, and to my surprise even my sister and her boyfriend, both of whom just might be less fond of the outdoors than me (somehow), stayed outside for the duration of the eclipse, barring brief trips to fetch things from the house.</p>

        <h3>And thus the wait began...</h3>
        <p>Totality was a couple hours out from the start of the affair, though it certainly didn't feel like it. Turns out time passes awfully fast waiting for syzygy to occur. It was so curious, you couldn't really comprehend the motion of the moon across the sun in the time frame you could safely look through the eclipse glasses, but as time wore on it seemed to be happening so fast regardless. I'm sure you might've seen pictures, but it's something wholly different to see in person. Especially through the telescopic lens we brought for the main camera, pointed straight up the entire time. Between myself and my parents we managed to fairly well document the whole process, with only a few gaps where there were some technical issues. The leadup itself was such an exciting experience, especially as we noticed some fairly evident changes aside from the moon in the way of the sun. The closer to totality we got, the less color there was in the air - a few minutes beforehand, everything had a sort of desaturated, or even bluish tint to it. As if someone had started fiddling with photomanipulation color sliders.</p>

        <h3>Of course, totality was something different altogether.</h3>
        <p>Just beforehand, we set up my mom's phone to record the shadow racing towards us, and thanks to technical difficulties once again, only managed to start filming about 20 seconds before the event. Still, when the shadow's speed is something close to 1500 miles per hour, about 20 seconds isn't going to matter from a stationary position on the surface. And despite the difficulties, we did manage to get it going in time. And, true to the immense speed of the event, it was pretty much light one second, and dark the next.</p>

        <h3>I have yet to see something so awe inspiring in my life as the total solar eclipse.</h3>
        <p>It was impossible to contain my excitement through the event, and it was impossible to miss a thing, while at the same time, there wasn't nearly enough time to comprehend it all. My eyes were everywhere at once, scanning the sky around us to see that it was twilight all about. As if the sun was setting in every direction at once. Venus could be seen to the right of the sun, and as we marveled, a plane flew to the east, no doubt host to at least a few very excited passengers. It was only a little over two and a half minutes, but it was incredible. It was possible to see coronal ejecta, solar flares, so many stunning things in the ring of light around the moon. I was able to stare with joy at the phenomena our ancestors hailed as a harbinger of the end. As excited as I was, I almost forgot that it had to end, and by the time I thought to check the time, it was nearly over. I gave the 30 second warning, and kept my glasses on hand as I tried to commit details to memory. Some are still vividly clear. Others have been lost to the haze of memory.</p>

        <h3>As it came to an end, it was a struggle to contain it all.</h3>
        <p>We watched the diamond ring form, returning to viewing through our glasses as light filled the sky again, returning it to its baby blue from its awe-inspiring purple and orange. I was almost disappointed - the twilight of the event had been nothing like what I expected, anticipating the darkness of a late night. Instead, I was given a beautiful twilight to witness, if only for a moment. We never saw any shadow snakes, but as light returned, it was like day breaking anew, only instead of long shadows, there were nearly none, the high angle of the sun leaving short, squat shadows at best, and creating a surreal "noon morning" effect. I wish I could properly put words to the phenomenon, but as with many things, I can't find them. And I'm not sure I ever will.</p>

        <h3>The remainder of the event passed as quickly as the rest.</h3>
        <p>My excitement left me giddy for almost an hour afterwards, still trying to work through all the amazing things I'd seen during the event proper. It was hard to keep myself from smiling, and time passed so quickly at first that I almost forgot to continue to look up. The second half of the event took little less time than the first of course, but between my excitement, and a lack of reference (I looked up less later on, both from distraction and a slow winding down), it seemed almost faster. Eventually, the ending of the event was punctuated as, with seconds left in the eclipse, a thick cloud, the first real cloud cover of the day, did its best impression of the moon a couple hours prior and obscured the sun.</p>

        <h3>All that was left was to pack up and head home.</h3>
        <p>For my family at least. I still had affairs to take care of. So after packing up, and investigating some restored tractors, we said our goodbyes and made our way home. Traffic was predictably awful. Before too long we took to side roads because they were almost bare, and made much better time, though we had to take a stretch of Meramac Bottom Road I'd never navigated to get there, and got slightly lost just before making it to campus. Still, we arrived in one piece, and as they left, I gathered up my computer and set off to join the class at large.</p>
